<h1>What is our project about?</h1>
Our submission for the <b>2k23 Progressio Open Senior Category (9-12)</b> features two robots running on the Arudino chip. These two robots uses the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to stay on a specific path. The unique part of this project is that the robot will stop if it detects that another robot is in front of it.
