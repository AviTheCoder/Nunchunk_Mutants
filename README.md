<h1><i><b>Nunchunk_Mutants</b></i></h1>
For Giis Progressio 2k23 Open Senior Category (9-12th) <br>
<h1>What is our project about?</h1>
Our submission for the <b>2k23 Progressio Open Senior Category (9-12)</b> features two robots running on the Arduino chip. These two robots uses the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to stay on a specific path. The unique part of this project is that the robot will stop if it detects that another robot is in front of it.<br>
We envision a new series of vehicles that increase safety and mobility, as well as contribute to achieving the UN sustainable development goals. Through our model of self-driving vehicles, we want to present an effective solution to working towards reducing the number of road accidents that happen everyday, worldwide. 
<h1>UNSDG's</h1>
The theme of the competition is the <b>United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</b>. <br>
Our Project connects with 3 of the UNSDGs<br>
Goals:
<ol>
<li>Goal 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure</li>
<li>Goal 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities</li>
<li>Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production</li>
</ol>
The <b>9th goal</b> focuses on building infrastructure and sustainable industrialization. Since our model will only use electricity, it will not produce greenhouse gases, therefore our model will be a very efficient way to transport men and materials, whether it is everyday transport or emergency situations.<br>
The <b>11th goal</b> focuses on safe transport systems. Since the model will stop when it detects anything in the front, this model will prove to be a very safe form of transportation. Therefore, it will significantly reduce the number of harmful road accidents that occur, and ensure sustainable urbanisation. <br>
Finally, the <b>12th goal</b> focuses on responsible production. As said eariler, the model only uses electricity (obtained from renewable sources). This model will be very useful in supporting developing countries in technological development.
<h1>Problems we faced (and solved)</h1>
On the first day, we didn't have all the parts to make both of the robots. However, it was easy to build a base with what we had. Our teammate Aviral made a good model of the robot at night. The next day, when Aviral was on his laptop using the
