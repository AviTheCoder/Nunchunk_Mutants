For Giis Progressio 2k23 Open Senior Catergory (9-12th) <br>
<h1>What is our project about?</h1>
Our submission for the <b>2k23 Progressio Open Senior Category (9-12)</b> features two robots running on the Arudino chip. These two robots uses the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to stay on a specific path. The unique part of this project is that the robot will stop if it detects that another robot is in front of it.
<h1>UNSDG</h1>
The theme of the competition is the <b>United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</b>. <br>
Our Project connects with 3 of the UNSDGs<br>
Goals:
<ol>
<li>Goal 9</li>
<li>Goal 11</li>
<li>Goal 12</li>
</ol>
The <b>9th goal</b> focuses on building infrastructure and sustainable industrialization. Since our model will only use electricity, it will not produce greenhouse gases, therefore our model will be a very efficient way to transport men and materials.<br>
The <b>11th goal</b> focuses on safe transport systems. Since the model will stop when it detects anything in the front, this model will prove to be a very safe form of transportation. <br>
Finally, the <b>12th goal</b> focuses on responsible production. As said eariler, the model only uses electricity (obtained from renewable sources). This model will be very useful in supporting developing countries in technological development.
<h1>Problems we faced</h1>
On the first day, we didn't have all the parts to make both of the robots. However, it was easy to build a base with what we had. Our teammate Aviral made a good model of the robot at night. The next day, when Aviral was on his laptop using the
